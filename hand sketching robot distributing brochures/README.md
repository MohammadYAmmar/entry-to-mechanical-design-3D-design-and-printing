# hand sketching of the robot distributing brochures

### <div>One of the training projects at the Smart methods Company is to design a robot drawing that distributes brochures to entrants to a specific exhibition or company</div>

### <div>Initially, I drew a hand sketching on a robot diagram according to the paper size. The distribution mechanism changes, for example, from the abdomen or the hand</div>

### <div>Then the 3D mechanical design can be started in programs like Blinder and cinema 4D</div>
