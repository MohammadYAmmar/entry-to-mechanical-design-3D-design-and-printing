# Introduction to mechanical design
Redesigning the arm is one of the tasks when I train at the Smart Methods Company

In this task I was my second mechanical design experiment, After that I liked Meshmixer

On first experience I took a r_forearm_visual and bust_motors_visual files to learn from
https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-humanoid/blob/master/hardware/URDF/meshes

This is the final design

While designing with programs, As long as the joint will have motors, I have shown the dimensions in Meshmixer

I have modified and redesign parts from source such as cutting excess parts and grouping

I could not save the file with the pieces used all in one file (STL) via Meshmixer, so I used blender for that and it was smooth in this thing

The project is also attached to the two programs and of course the design is in STL format.
