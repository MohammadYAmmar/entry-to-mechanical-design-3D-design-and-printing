# Introduction to mechanical design
Redesigning the arm is one of the tasks when I train at the Smart Methods Company

In this mission I was my first mechanical design experiment, and I tried to use several programs such as the FourD cinema and Blinder and the Tinker CAD website.

After that I liked Meshmixer, it is beautiful and has the required options like insulation and bool

On first experience I took a r_upper_arm_visual file to learn from
https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-humanoid/blob/master/hardware/URDF/meshes/r_upper_arm_visual.STL

This is the final design for his first experience

Either this is an image when I entered ultimaker Cura to take a look at how to put the file in it and the types of 3D printersultimaker Cura 4.6
